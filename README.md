My hash function program:

# Custom Hasher with GUI

## Project Description
This program implements a custom hash function using Python. The application uses a user-friendly GUI built with `tkinter`, allowing users to hash inputs, save/load results, and view them interactively.

## Features
- **Custom Hash Function**: Processes any string input and generates a deterministic 8-character hash.
- **Predefined Test Cases**: Runs various inputs to demonstrate the hash function's capabilities.
- **Interactive GUI**: Add custom inputs, view results, and toggle dark mode.
- **JSON Integration**: Save results to and load them from JSON files, supporting dynamic file selection.
- **Dark Mode**: Offers a visually appealing alternative to the default light theme.

## Requirements
- Python 
- `tkinter` (included in standard Python library)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
3. Use the GUI to interact with the program.
