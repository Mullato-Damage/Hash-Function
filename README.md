# Hash-Function
A program implementing a custom hash function with an interactive GUI.

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a custom hash function in Python, wrapped in a user-friendly GUI built with `tkinter`. The program allows users to hash inputs, view results, and save/load hashed outputs interactively. It showcases the principles of hashing, GUI design, and file handling.

## Features
- **Custom Hash Function**: Processes any string input and generates a deterministic 8-character hash.
- **Predefined Test Cases**: Runs various test inputs to demonstrate the hash function's capabilities.
- **Interactive GUI**:
  - Add custom inputs and view their hashes.
  - Toggle between light and dark modes.
- **JSON Integration**:
  - Save hashed results to JSON files.
  - Load hashed results from any JSON file.
- **Dark Mode**: Offers a visually appealing alternative to the default light theme.

## Requirements
- Python
- `tkinter` (included in the standard Python library)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
3. Use the GUI to interact with the program.
